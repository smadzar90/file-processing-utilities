Filtering and reversing a file using a stack and queue constructed with a singly linked list

## FileReverser
Reversing a file using a stack constructed with a singly linked list. The program reads the characters from the file and pushes them into the stack including the whitespaces and line changes. After the characters are pushed, the program pops the characters from the stack and prints it to a new file. 

Example: 

Input file:

Hello World

Bye

Output file:

eyB

dlroW olleH
